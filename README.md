# iphex

IPhex is a very simple shell script to convert IP addresses to HEX format.

## Usage

Simple as `iphex IPADDRESS`

    $ iphex 127.0.0.1
    7F000001

## Install

The script installs itself in `/usr/local/bin` by running `make install`

## License

Don't worry about the license. It's so small, everyone can write this in a couple of minutes (as I have done). Just use it and do whatever you want to do with it.
